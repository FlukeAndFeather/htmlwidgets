### threejs
<https://github.com/bwlewis/rthreejs>

threejs includes a 3D scatterplot and 3D globe (you can directly manipulate the scatterplot below with the mouse).

```{r message = FALSE}
library(threejs)
z <- seq(-10, 10, 0.01)
x <- cos(z)
y <- sin(z)
scatterplot3js(x,y,z, color=rainbow(length(z)))
```
